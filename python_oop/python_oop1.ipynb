    "The two common programming paradigms are <b>procedural programming paradigm\n",
    "</b>and <b>object oriented programming</b><br><p>\n",
    "    In the <b>procedural paradigm,</b> there is a step by step procedure that is followed sequentially\n",
    "for solving a specific problem.<b>\n",
    "    It is implemented through code blocks called functions</b>.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    In <b>object oriented programming,</b> real world entities or concepts are modelled using objects.<br>\n",
    "An object has both state and behaviour, means it contains both data and code to manipulate\n",
    "that data.\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "So in procedural programming, you model your program in terms of functions and in object\n",
    "oriented programming you model your program in terms of objects.</p>\n"
